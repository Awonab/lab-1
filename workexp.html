    <p>I am a student at Ashesi University, majoring in Management Information Systems. 
        I had the privilege of working for Cedar Mountain International School as an Administrative Intern, 
        where I learned valuable professional skills such as teamwork as 
        I had to work with staff of the school and client communication from my in my interactions with parents. 
        In both my academic and personal life, I have been consistently praised as adaptable by my professors 
        and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or personal projects.</p>
